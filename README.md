# DU — Dopamine Units
### Cognitive Economics for the Digital Age

> **"Mint.com for your Neurotransmitters."**

**DU** is a mobile application that gamifies dopamine regulation. By treating mental energy and willpower as a finite daily currency ("Dopamine Units"), it helps users visualize the biological cost of cheap gratification and the investment value of deep work.

## The Concept
Modern apps are designed to hijack our dopamine reward pathways. **DU** is designed to reclaim them.

Grounded in behavioral psychology concepts like **Ego Depletion** and **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)**, the app operates on a simple premise:
* **The Bank:** You wake up with **100 DU**.
* **The Cost:** High-dopamine activities (doomscrolling, sugar, vices) cost DU.
* **The Income:** Restorative activities (meditation, deep work, cold exposure) earn DU.
* **The Crash:** When you hit 0 DU, you enter "Debt," visually representing the physiological crash that follows over-stimulation.

## Features (MVP)
* **The Dopamine Bank:** Real-time visualization of your current mental balance.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A futuristic, translucent interface designed to feel distinct from standard productivity tools.
* **Haptic Feedback Engine:** Physical tactile feedback differentiating "spending" (heavy vibration) vs. "earning" (crisp tap) to reinforce operant conditioning.
* **Transaction Ledger:** A history of your behavioral economy.

## Tech Stack & Methodology

This project explores **AI-Augmented Engineering**. As a Data Scientist, I utilized LLM-driven development tools ("Antigravity" workflows) to rapidly scaffold the React Native frontend, allowing me to focus on product architecture, logic, and behavioral design.

* **Framework:** React Native (via Expo)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **UI System:** `expo-blur`, `expo-linear-gradient` (Custom Glassmorphism implementation)
* **State Management:** Custom Hooks + AsyncStorage (Local Persistence)

## Roadmap: The "Insight Engine"
Currently, DU acts as the data collection layer. The next phase involves integrating my background in Data Science and Machine Learning to build the **Predictive Backend**:

* **Phase 2:** Integrate Python backend (FastAPI).
* **Phase 3:** Train a model on user timestamps and spending habits to predict "Dopamine Crashes" before they happen.
* **Phase 4:** Implement "Urge Surfing" intervention tools using LLM-generated personalized coaching.
