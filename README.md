# DU — Dopamine Units
### Cognitive Economics for the Digital Age

> **"Mint.com for your Neurotransmitters."**

**DU** is a mobile application that gamifies dopamine regulation. By treating mental energy and willpower as a finite daily currency ("Dopamine Units"), it helps users visualize the biological cost of cheap gratification and the investment value of deep work.

## The Concept
Modern apps are designed to hijack our dopamine reward pathways. **DU** is designed to reclaim them.

Grounded in behavioral psychology concepts like **Ego Depletion** and **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)**, the app operates on a simple premise:
* **The Bank:** You wake up with **100 DU**.
* **The Cost:** High-dopamine activities (doomscrolling, sugar, vices) cost DU.
* **The Income:** Restorative activities (meditation, deep work, cold exposure) earn DU.
* **The Crash:** When you hit 0 DU, you enter "Debt," visually representing the physiological crash that follows over-stimulation.

## Features (MVP)
* **The Dopamine Bank:** Real-time visualization of your current mental balance.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A futuristic, translucent interface designed to feel distinct from standard productivity tools.
* **Haptic Feedback Engine:** Physical tactile feedback differentiating "spending" (heavy vibration) vs. "earning" (crisp tap) to reinforce operant conditioning.
* **Transaction Ledger:** A history of your behavioral economy.
